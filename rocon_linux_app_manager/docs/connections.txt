Clients can be:

1) invited
2) make connections (or request an invitation)

Is making a connection, anything other than a request to be invited?

Aha, there is a difference. By default, the door to the concert master 
should be closed. Not everyone should be able to freely connect to it.

Fact: the door is open. If we zeroconf'ing that door, any dog can join.
